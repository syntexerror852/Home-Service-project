## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- PostgreSQL

### 🧰 Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    Django
    psycopg2-binary
    Pillow
    ```
    Then, install the packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables (Recommended for Security)**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project. **Do not commit this file to Git.** Add your sensitive information here:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key
    DEBUG=True
    
    DB_NAME=your_db_name
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

    EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
    EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
    ```
    To use these variables, you will need to install a package like `python-decouple`:
    ```bash
    pip install python-decouple
    ```
    Then, in `settings.py`, import `config` from `decouple` and replace your hardcoded settings.
    
    ```python
    # settings.py
    from decouple import config

    SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
    DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)
    
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': config('DB_NAME'),
            'USER': config('DB_USER'),
            'PASSWORD': config('DB_PASSWORD'),
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = config('EMAIL_USER')
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = config('EMAIL_PASS')
    ```

5.  **Set up the Database**
    In PostgreSQL, create a new database that matches the `DB_NAME` you set in your `.env` file.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;
    ```
    Then, run the Django migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a Superuser**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7.  **Run the Server**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will be available at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`**.

## 🖥️ Usage

-   **Admin**: Log in with your superuser account. You will be redirected to the admin dashboard to manage the platform.
-   **Worker**: Register through the "Become a Provider" flow. Your account will be inactive until an Admin verifies you.
